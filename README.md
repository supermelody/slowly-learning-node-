<h2> Notes on learning Node through an OSX Terminal
<h3> Github </h3>


Github is used to store, update, collaborate and discuss growing projects which are refered to as repositories or repos. Git keeps a log of all 'pushed' changes and improvements so all co-developers or just users can be updated. 




Node projects come as collections of files which connect with one another. One method is with the `require` function. There also have external files they depend on which need to be installed thats where NPM comes in. 

When you [install node](https://nodejs.org/en/) it will come with npm but to avoid admin issues also [install NVM] (https://github.com/creationix/nvm) 

<h3> Patchwork </h3> 

To download patchwork to your computer you can use this line in the terminal  
<code> git clone https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork </code>
or get the zip from the [repo.](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork)  

After navigating to the /patchwork forder run 
`npm install`
This will scan the folder for dependant packages hence the name 'node package manager'

Open readme.md in a markdown viewer like [hackMD](hackMD.io) 
Its a document filled with special formatting so it looks good on the github repo page and is filled with vital info like how to install.
